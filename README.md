# CSCI 466 - Databases Project
Project for CSCI 466 where we implement a Karaoke Website using PDO and MariaDB (php), HTML, and CSS. You must run the SQL files in your own MariaDB webserver and host
the files in the webserver as well in order to make these work.

~~To see an example of this project working, [click here](https://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1895668/cs466proj/webpage_files/startpage.html).~~

## Update (01-18-2024):  
The MariaDB database host provided to us by the university has changed currently, so the above link will not work as it cannot connect to the database.
This might change in the future if the university restores access to the database host. To see it in action, you need to manually run the `.sql` files in your own MariaDB webserver.

In the future, we might host this project on our own machines, but we have no current plans of doing so at the moment.
